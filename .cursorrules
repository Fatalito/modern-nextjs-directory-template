# AI Instructions & Project Rules

You are an expert AI assistant working on a scalable **Next.js** project.
These rules must be followed in every response, code generation, and refactoring task.

## 1. Project Stack & Architecture

- **Framework:** Next.js 16+ (App Router, Server Components).
- **Runtime:** Node.js v24 (verify via `.nvmrc`).
- **Language:** TypeScript (Strict mode).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4.
- **Linting & Formatting:** Biome (Use `biome check` and `biome format`).
- **Testing:**
  - **Unit:** Vitest (React Testing Library).
  - **E2E/Integration:** Playwright.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Structure:** Feature-Sliced Design (FSD).
    - `src/shared`: Reusable low-level code (ui kit, libs, api).
    - `src/entities`: Business entities (e.g., user, post).
    - `src/features`: User interactions (e.g., login, like-post).
    - `src/widgets`: Compositional blocks (e.g., header, sidebar).
    - `src/views`: Composition of widgets for specific routes.
    - `src/app`: App-wide settings, styles, and routing.
  - **Routing:** Multi-Zones strategy with Route Groups for isolation: `(listing)`, `(dashboard)`, `(blog)`, `(admin)`.

## 2. Coding Style: Strict Functional Programming

- **NO Classes:** Do not use the `class` keyword. Inheritance is forbidden.
- **Pure Functions:** Prefer pure functions. Side effects must be isolated.
- **Arrow Functions:** Use `const func = () => { ... }` for everything.
- **Factories over Classes:**
  - Use **Factory Functions** to create objects or service instances.
  - Use **Closures** within factories to hold private state.
- **Explicit Interfaces:** Always define return types for factory functions.

### Example: Factory Pattern
```typescript
type CounterService = {
  increment: () => void;
  getCount: () => number;
};

const createCounterService = (initialValue: number = 0): CounterService => {
  // Private state via closure
  let count = initialValue;

  const increment = () => {
    count += 1;
  };

  const getCount = () => count;

  return { increment, getCount };
};
```

## 3. SOLID Principles (Functional Adaptation)

- **SRP (Single Responsibility):** Each module/factory does one thing.
- **OCP (Open/Closed):** Extend behavior via composition, not modification.
- **LSP (Liskov Substitution):** Interfaces must be interchangeably implemented.
- **ISP (Interface Segregation):** Return small, focused interfaces.
- **DIP (Dependency Inversion):**
  - **Inject dependencies** as arguments to factory functions.
  - **Never** instantiate dependencies inside the factory.

### Dependency Injection Example
```typescript
// BAD
const createUserService = () => {
  const db = createDatabase(); // Internal coupling
  // ...
};

// GOOD
const createUserService = (db: Database) => {
  // ...
};
```

## 4. Naming Conventions

### Factory Functions
1.  **`create...` (Control/Factory)**
    - Returns an interface/object the caller **must** use to control behavior.
    - Used for: Complex creation logic, creating mockable services, UI component encapsulation.
    - Example: `createKeepAliveManager()` -> `{ start, stop }`

2.  **`start...` (Fire-and-Forget)**
    - Initiates a process running in the background.
    - Caller does not need to interact with the result constantly.
    - Example: `startHealthServer()`

### Files & Directories
- **Kebab-case** for file names: `user-profile.tsx`, `auth-service.ts`.
- **camelCase** for exported constants/functions.
- **PascalCase** for Types and React Components.

## 5. Development Workflow

- **TDD (Test Driven Development):**
  1.  Write a failing test (Vitest/Playwright).
  2.  Implement the minimal code to pass.
  3.  Refactor while keeping green.
- **Atomic Commits:** Small, descriptive commits focused on a single feature or fix.
- **Branching:** Create feature branches (e.g., `feat/blog-page`) and PRs.

## 6. General Guidelines
- **Avoid Defaults:** Use named exports unless required by Next.js specific files (like `page.tsx`).
- **Error Handling:** Prefer returning `Result` types (success/failure objects) over `throw` for logic errors. Reserve `try/catch` for boundary layers or async calls that throw.
- **License:** Apache 2.0.

Remember: Quality, Consistency, and Maintainability are paramount.
