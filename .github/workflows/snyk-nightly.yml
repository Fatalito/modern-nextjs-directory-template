name: Snyk Security Scan

# Nightly dependency vulnerability scan against main.
#
# Runs on a schedule instead of per-PR because:
# - CVEs are discovered daily, not per-commit
# - Blocking PRs for pre-existing vulnerabilities is misleading
# - npm audit handles "did this PR introduce a vuln" per-PR
# - Snyk's value is monitoring the live dependency graph over time
