name: Update Performance Baseline

# Manual workflow to update performance baseline metrics.
# 
# Run this workflow after:
# - Intentional performance improvements (lower thresholds)
# - Accepting performance trade-offs (feature worth slowdown)
# - Infrastructure upgrades (Node version, Next.js, etc.)
# - Quarterly baseline refresh

            ## Performance Baseline Update

            Updated baseline metrics from CI environment.
            
            - Runs: ${{ inputs.run_count }}
            - Environment: ubuntu-latest
            - Node: 20
            
            **Review checklist:**
            - [ ] Values look reasonable for CI environment
            - [ ] No unexpected changes from previous baseline
