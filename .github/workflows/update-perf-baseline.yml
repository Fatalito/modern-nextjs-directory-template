name: Update Performance Baseline

# Manual workflow to update performance baseline metrics.
# 
# Run this workflow after:
# - Intentional performance improvements (lower thresholds)
# - Accepting performance trade-offs (feature worth slowdown)
# - Infrastructure upgrades (Node version, Next.js, etc.)
# - Quarterly baseline refresh

            ## Performance Baseline Update

            Updated baseline metrics from CI environment.

            - Runs: 3 iterations per test
            - Environment: ubuntu-latest
            - Node: 24

            **Review checklist:**
            - [ ] Playwright timing values (`perf-baseline.json`) look reasonable for CI environment
            - [ ] Lighthouse scores (`lighthouse-baseline.json`) look reasonable
            - [ ] No unexpected changes from previous baseline
